# Navigation
The Navigation Architecture Component helps you easily implement common, but complex navigation requirements, while also helping you visualize your app's navigation flow. The library provides a number of benefits, including:
- Handling fragment transactions
- Handling up and back correctly by default
- Provides defaults for animations and transitions
- Deep linking is a first class operation
- Navigation UI patterns like navigation drawers and bottom nav with little additional work
- Type safety when passing information while navigating
- Android Studio offers tooling for visualizing and editing the navigation flow of an app
